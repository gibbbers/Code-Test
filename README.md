# Code-Test
Just a response to a test;

Hey Filip, I re-coded the code test in Python with some improvements. There is now a slightly nicer layout with more responses and things like that.
I hope this codetest is better and I was curious how you felt about it. I worked harder on this one and I hope I have improved. Thanks!
